Hello My name is Xu Xiao, and today I would like to share with you my digital portfolio.The core of my portfolio is built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Okay, Lets start it! This is the home page. The home page introduces me and gives a brief overview of my journey from China to California, my academic background, and my passion for software development. As you can see, I built a real-time clock, this clock is powered by javascript function.  This function fetches the current time using the JavaScript Date object, formats it into a human-readable format, and then updates the text content of the current-time element in the HTML. For the body, the shadow effect is applied using the box-shadow property. At the bottom of the homepage. I created 4 hyperlinks to other pages.

Now, let's go to next page. Do you notice that? I used CSS animation for navigation links, which gradually appear with a slight delay, contribute to a more dynamic interface." In this project, One of the codes I'm most proud of is the JavaScript function for page transitions. It adds a fade-out effect when navigating between pages, making the user experience smoother and more engaging. In this page. I used unordered list and table to store my basic information.

This is the interest page.  This section of my portfolio is to sharing my love for video games, with a focus on Overwatch. For the video, I use iframe element to get the embeded youtube video, and applied shadpw effect on its border.

This is the hometown page. Here, you can learn about the culture and history of my hometown. I use vue to create a data-driven gallery: the images, titles, and descriptions of each gallery item are stored in the Vue instance's data object. I used v-for directive to loop over these items and display them on the page. 

The last page is the contact page. I created a form in HTML with inputs for name, email, phone, and a textarea for the message. These inputs are designed to capture user information. I also used validation attributes like required and pattern to make sure the inputs are correct before submission. In order to send the email, i built a function through smtp.js library. This function is triggered by submission.
