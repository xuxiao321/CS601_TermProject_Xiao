            <p>Hello there! My name is Xu Xiao, and I'm delighted to share a bit about myself with you. I originally
                hail from the vibrant and culturally rich country of China where I spent my early years. Currently, I
                call the sunny state of California my home.</p>

            <p>In my academic journey, I pursued a major in economics at the City College of New York. Exploring the
                intricate workings of economies and understanding how they impact societies fascinated me. However, as
                life is an ever-evolving journey, I found myself drawn towards a new passionâ€”software development. This
                newfound interest led me to enroll as a master's student at Boston University, where I am currently
                immersed in the dynamic world of software development. </p>

            <p>The world of software development offers boundless opportunities for creativity, problem-solving, and
                making a tangible impact on people's lives. It provides a platform to innovate, create solutions, and be
                part of a community that is driving the next wave of progress. I am excited about the challenges and
                possibilities that come with this field and am eager to apply my skills and knowledge in the
                ever-expanding realm of technology.</p>

        <section>
            <p>As I navigate through this exciting chapter at Boston University, I am enthusiastic about the journey
                ahead, confident that my background in economics and my new venture into software development will
                converge to shape a unique and fulfilling career path. Thank you for taking the time to learn a little
                bit about me!</p>
